    nudge is a super simple WinForms system tray app for triggering HID inputs when user inactivity is detected.
  </p>
</div>

## What it do?

Runs silently in the system tray and monitors for user inactivity. If you're inactive for longer than the user defined threshold, user defined HID inputs are executed.
Right now we can:
- Jiggle the cursor...
- Perform a single keystroke of a user defined key.

### Nothing more to say about this one.
